The vote is open for a minimum of 72 hours and passes if a majority of at least
three +1 PMC votes are cast.

[ ] +1 Release ${PROJECT_NAME} ${VERSION}
[ ]  0 I don't have a strong opinion about this, but I assume it's ok
[ ] -1 Do not release ${PROJECT_NAME} ${VERSION} because...

Here is my vote:

+1 (binding)
